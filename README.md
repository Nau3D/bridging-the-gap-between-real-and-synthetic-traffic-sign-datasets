This work aims at generating synthetic traffic sign datasets. These datasets can be be used to train CNN models that provide high levels of accuracy when tested with real data.

We employ traditional techniques for the generation of our synthetic samples, and explore two new operators: Perlin and Confetti Noise. These two operators proved essential in helping us achieve accuracies that are extremelly close to those obtained with real data datasets.

These datasets are created based only on a set of templates. We tested our synthetic datasets against three known Traffic Sign datasets:

- GTSRB
- BTSC
- rMASTIF

Here are some samples generated by our script for the German Traffic Sign Repository Benchmark:

As opposed to previous works such as [1] and [2] we didn´t aim at achieving photo-realistic imagery for our synthetic samples, yet we were able to achieve state of the art results with our approach.
